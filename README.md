---------------------------##### Who's That Pokemon?! Game ##### ------------------------
### The application is based on a childhood show called Pokemon.
During the middle of the show the famous 'Who's That Pokemon?!' would appear and as a fan, you would try your hardest to guess the Pokemon based off the shape shown on the screen. Since then the Pokedex has increased! Are you up for  challenge?

#### The tools that made this project possible include:

#React- was used to fetch the data from the PokeAPI. It was used to create components for our virtual DOM and contains our logic for the application.
--- ### React Component
--- ### React redux
--- ###

#HTML- Is our canvas! Here we are using HTML in order to visualize our application. It's where our virtual DOM is being shown.

#CSS- Is used to style our application.
